Day 3 Quiz

----------

1.  The *args parameter packs n number of positional arguments into a ____tuple?
    The **kwargs parameter packs n number of named arguments into a ____dictionary?

2.  Runtime code at the top level of a module will always run in an importing script, true or false?
    Can you write the special condition we can use to hide it from the importing script?
    if __name__ == "__main__":

3. How does one access the attributes and methods of an object?
dot notation
 
4. Class names should be in what style?
CamelCase
 
5. Which dunder (D-ouble UNDER-score) method is called (indirectly) when you FIRST create an object of a class?
__init__
 
6. The first param. of each method in a class is conventionally named self. 
To what does this param. refer?
itself - the empty object while under construction 
 
7. How many objects are created in the following 2 LOC?

class_a = ClassA() 

class_b = class_a

just one
 
8. Which dunder method should we override in our own custom classes 
to obtain a meaningful representation of our objects' properties, 
once we have made the object? 

__str__
if not overridden, it will run the __str__ of Object, which will be a memory reference

9. Which function is pure, a or b?

thing = 1

def a():

    print(thing)
 
def b(thing):

    print(thing)

b - a COPY of the data is passed in through the parameter
 
10. Which of the two functions below has a closure, outer_a or outer_b? 
Note that both functions compile and run, and both return an inner function called add_to_lst.
Don't be surprised if you can't see the answer at first. 
This question involves reasoning about the code.

def outer_a():

    lst = []                

    def add_to_lst(item):
        nonlocal lst        
        lst.append(item)
        return lst        
    return add_to_lst
 
lst = []

def outer_b():

    def add_to_lst(item):
        global lst
        lst.append(item)
        return lst
    return add_to_lst

outer_a - it has a nonlocal variable
